          <h1>Gregory Szymanski</h1>
          <h2>Full Stack Developer + Team Player</h2>
          <p>I am a developer who over time has worked on both server and client software. Through those experiences I am on the path of mastering the complex process of building and improving full stack projects. My current focus is mastering how build projects with Spring and Angular. </p>
          <p>Outside of being a great programmer I also aim to be a supportive team member. I truly believe that great things are made by individuals, but masterpieces are created by groups of people. So wherever fate takes me I always hope to elevate not only myself but also team members that work with me.</p>

          <h2>About The Page</h2>
          <p>Welcome to my personal website.  Consider this place as my playground where I experiment with different web technologies and programming techniques, while also writing about myself as a software developer and person. Right now, the page is a simple static website, hosted on GitHub. I know, it’s nothing impressive, but as the famous meme says, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=its+ain+much+but+its+honest+work+famous+meme&source=lmns&bih=886&biw=1745&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjoiJ-M9KD1AhXCr3IEHcx1DRwQ_AUoAHoECAEQAA">it’s ain’t much, but it’s honest work.</a> Being a software developer means you should continuously learn new subjects and technologies, and by making my own virtual space, that is open to the public, I want to create extra motivation for myself to build something, that people can see and observe how it improves over time, without me having the extra pressure of needing to complete it right away. I consider this my safe space, where I am free to test things, check how they work and look and learn new practices without the fear of making a mistake. Here mistakes are encouraged because it's something I can safely learn from. I am especially excited about diving into some front-end technologies since most of my current work involves back-end projects.</p>
          <p>I would like to shout-out to <a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/christinatruong">Christina Truong</a> and her CSS Essential Training on LinkedIn Learning. I am a big fan of self-learning and online educational videos, and I used a lot of the techniques Christina showed in her CSS course to create the first draft of my personal page. Over time I want to incorporate other things I learn from different resources and see how they work together in one project.</p>
